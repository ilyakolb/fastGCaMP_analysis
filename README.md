Requirements
============
MATLAB 2019a+


Installation
============

Add ./accessory_funcs to MATLAB path

Usage
===========

1. Open kerr_plot_CGaMP96uf.m. Set the 'good' variable to point to the data_all text file e.g. in Y:\GENIE_Pipeline\Analysis\Results\data_all_20190704_GCaMP96uf.txt
2. Set the variables to plot (xToPlot, yToPlot, etc) according to the field names in the 'good' table
3. To run the hit analysis on particular constructs of interests, run the interactive code compare_constructs_GCaMP96uf_mlx.mlx
	In the 'hits' cell array, put in mutant names you want to look at (e.g. '500.333') 
	In the 'control' field, set the name of the control (e.g. '10.921' for jGCaMP7f)
	Set 'plotRaw' to 1 if you want to plot individual responses from wells in each constructs. Also set numSampleWells to limit how many wells per construct will be plotted.
	Set launchFiji to 1 to automatically launch Fiji from the plotRawCellData script. Only happens if 'plotRaw' is set to 1.

NOTES: 

- Remember to set hardcoded directories in plotRawCellData.m. 
- launchFiji can be buggy
- make sure nearline is mounted
